## Project Overview
This is my personal HTML5/CSS3 portfolio website that I built for Assignment 1.  
It showcases my skills in web development with a clean and modern design.


## Features
- Navigation bar across all pages (Home | About Me | Projects | Contact Me)  
- Black and purple theme with subtle gradient accents  
- About Me page with a video and picture  
- Projects page for showcasing any projects I choose to add  
- Contact page with a form that validates name, email, phone, and comments  
- Fully responsive design for mobile, tablet, and laptop  



## Responsive Design (Viewport Sizes)
- **Mobile (mobile.css)** → max-width: 600px  
- **Tablet (tablet.css)** → 601px – 900px  
- **Laptop (laptop.css)** → min-width: 901px  

These were chosen so that content remains readable and layouts look balanced on any device.
